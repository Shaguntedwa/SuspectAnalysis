# 🕵️ Pandas Detective: The Missing Backpack Mystery

In this Level 3 project, I used **Pandas** to investigate a suspicious incident at a magical school. A backpack went missing. Students were interrogated (a.k.a filtered), and the guilty-looking ones were isolated using logic.

## 🧩 Dataset

The dataset (`school_data.csv`) includes:
- 🏠 House
- 🍫 Chocolate wrappers
- 🕰️ Library time
- 🎒 Backpack weight
- 🔥 Detentions

---

## 🔍 What I Did

- Learned to use Pandas for filtering, grouping, sorting
- Identified chocolate hoarders, heavy backpack carriers, and library slackers
- Built a final **suspect list** using multi-condition logic
- Exported to `suspect_list.csv`
- Learned `apply()`, custom functions, and condition combinations

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas

---

## 🧠 Lessons Learned

- Data isn't just numbers — it's behavior
- With logic, patterns reveal themselves
- Pandas makes complex filtering *simple and powerful*

---

## 🚀 Next Level

- Add visualizations (bar plot for houses vs detentions)
- Use Matplotlib or Seaborn
- Build GUI or detective dashboard
